# Bug: Search results return incomplete file paths in compact mode

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem
When `CompactMode` is enabled, search operations (`advanced_text_search` and `smart_search`) return only the filename without the full path.

## Example
**Expected:**
```
1 matches: C:\__REPOS\jotajotape\CRM\Intct.jotajotape.com\crm\ApplicationRole.cs:6
```

**Actual (before fix):**
```
1 matches: ApplicationRole.cs:6
```

## Impact
This made it impossible for `intelligent_read` to locate and read the found files, as it received an incomplete path.

## Root Cause
In `core/search_operations.go`, the compact mode formatting used `filepath.Base()` which strips the directory path, leaving only the filename.

Affected lines:
- Line 145: `advanced_text_search` results
- Lines 269, 277: `smart_search` filename matches
- Lines 300, 308: `smart_search` content matches

## Solution ✅
Replaced `filepath.Base(match.File)` with `match.File` to always return full absolute paths, even in compact mode.

### Changes Made:
1. **Line 146** in `AdvancedTextSearch`: Changed from `filepath.Base(match.File)` to `match.File`
2. **Lines 271, 280** in `performSmartSearch`: Changed from `filepath.Base(...)` to full path
3. **Lines 304, 313** in `performSmartSearch`: Changed from `filepath.Base(m.File)` to `m.File`

## Resolution
Fixed in commit: Search operations now return complete absolute paths in all modes.
